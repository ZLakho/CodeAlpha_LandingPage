                characteristics we associate with intelligence in human behavior – understanding language, learning,
                reasoning, solving problems, and so on.” </b><br> - (Barr & Feigenbaum, 1981)</p>

                <h2>What is AI?</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 15px;text-align: left;"> Artificial intelligence is the science of making machines
                    that can think like humans. It can do things that are considered "smart." AI technology can process
                    large amounts of data in ways, unlike humans. The goal for AI is to be able to do things such as
                    recognize patterns, make decisions, and judge like humans.

                <h2>Scope of AI</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 15px;">The scope of Artificial Intelligence is limited to domestic and commercial
                    purposes as the medical and aviation sectors are also using AI to improve their services. If AI is
                    outperforming human efforts, then opting for AI automation will reduce costs in the long run for a
                    business.</p>

            <h3>1. Machine learning</h3>
            <p>Machine Learning is the technique that gives computers the potential to learn without being programmed,
                it is actively being used in daily life, machine learning applications in daily life, even without
                knowing that. Fundamentally, it is the science that enables machines to translate, execute and
                investigate data for solving real-world problems.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="logic">
            <h3>2. Neural Network</h3>
            <p>In simple terms, a neural network is a set of algorithms that are used to find the elemental
                relationships across the bunches of data via the process that imitates the human brain operating
                process. <br>So, a neural network refers to a system of neurons that are original or artificial in
                nature, where artificial neurons are known as perceptrons, know from here, the complete perceptron model
                in the neural network.</p>

            <h3>3. Robotics</h3>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Robotics is an interdisciplinary field of science and engineering incorporated with mechanical
                    engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, and many others.</li>
                <li>Robotics determines the designing, producing, operating, and usage of robots. It deals with computer
                    systems for their control, intelligent outcomes, and information transformation.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>4. Expert Systems</h3>
            <p>Under the umbrella of an AI technology, an expert system refers to a computer system that mimics the
                decision-making intelligence of a human expert. It conducts this by deriving knowledge from its
                knowledge base by implementing reasoning and insights rules in terms with the user queries.</p>

        <section class="logic">
            <h3>5. Fuzzy Logic</h3>
            <p>In simpler terms, Fuzzy logic is a technique that represents and modifies uncertain information by
                measuring the degree to which the hypothesis is correct. Fuzzy logic is also used for reasoning about
                naturally uncertain concepts. Fuzzy logic is convenient and flexible to implement machine learning
                techniques and assist in imitating human thought logically.</p>

            <h3>6. Natural Language Processing </h3>
            <p>NLP is a method that deals in searching, analyzing, understanding and deriving information from the text
                form of data. In order to teach computers how to extract meaningful information from the text data, NLP
                libraries are used by programmers. A common example of NLP is spam detection, computer algorithms can
                check whether an email is a junk or not by looking at the subject of a line, or text of an email.</p>
